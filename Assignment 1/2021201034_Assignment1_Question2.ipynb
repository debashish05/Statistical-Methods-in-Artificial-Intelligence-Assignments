In the size of the matrix is very large, it might not work or result in very high latency using virtual memory. Where as FAISS try to compress the matrix and it work on that form. It is faster than vanilla KNN. It is optimized for memory and speed and compromises very less on accuracy. It's time complexity is O(nlogn^2) and try to parallise and gain speed. GPU can speed up the algorithm speed. FAISS uses clustering to find the simillar neigbhour.
